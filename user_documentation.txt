Overview
Subs-tracker is an all-in-one website used to manage and track all your subscriptions.

Choose subscriptions from a shared list or create custom subscriptions with your own
information. Receive notifications for upcoming payments, and integrate with
RescueTime's screentime tracker to be notified of unused payments.

Getting Started

Home View
The "Home View" provides a quick overview of your subscriptions, including your most
used subscriptions, spending by category, upcoming payments, and unused subscriptions.

Add a Subscription
To begin tracking your subscriptions, head to the "Shared List" section. You can find a
subscription from the existing database using the search and sort filters. As well, you
can add your own subscriptions using the "Add Plan" button.
Once you have found a subscription, press the "+" button to add it to your own list.
Select your most closest payment date from the calendar pop-up.

Manage your subscriptions
"My List" section provides a detailed view of your subscriptions. Subscription
information such as category, cost, and due date are displayed to help manage your
subscriptions. Click the arrow buttons to sort, and filter icons to apply filters on the
relevant columns.
For example, you can find your most expensive subscriptions on a monthly basis by
setting the period filter to "Month", which will display normalized costs per month, and
applying a sort to the cost column.
You will also see a "usage score" column. This grades your usage of a particular
subscription based on optional integrated screentime data from Rescuetime. If you allow
notifications in settings, you will also be notified of any unused subscriptions based
on a user-defined threshold for usage.

Create New Subscription
The "Add New Plan" page allows you to add a custom subscription to your list, which will
also be displayed on the shared list. Subscription details can be inputted on the form,
with a realtime preview displayed alongside.
The "subscription" field allows you to input an existing service or create your own with
the "+" button. Choosing a category will then update the service with the new category.
The "track usage" and "next payment date" fields are specific to the subscription added
to your list, and will not display on the shared list.

My Budget
Finally, head to the "My Budget" section to create a budget for your subscriptions.
Input a maximum value, and optionally select a category to apply the budget to. Press
the "Set Budget" button to apply.
The website will then find relevant subscription to fit within your budget while
prioritizing useful subscriptions (highest usage scores). As well, the dropdown arrow
will display your current subscriptions that are selected in budget.

Notifications
To set up notifications for upcoming payments and unused subscriptions, head to the
"Settings" section of the website.
Under the "Notifications" section, enable the toggle for "Notify me about upcoming
payments" to receive alerts for any upcoming subscription renewals. You can also set a
custom threshold for unused subscriptions and be notified when a subscription's usage
drops below that threshold, based on your RescueTime screentime data.
To integrate with RescueTime's screentime tracker, you need to input your RescueTime API
key. Simply navigate to the "API Integration" section within the settings and paste your
API key in the designated field.
Once entered, the integration will be active, and you will start receiving notifications
based on your screentime usage. You can adjust the thresholds and notification
preferences as needed to fit your tracking needs.
